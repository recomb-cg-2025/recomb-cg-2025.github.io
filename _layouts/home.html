  <h1>Welcome to the 22nd RECOMB-CG</h1>
  
  <p>The 22nd RECOMB-CG conference is co-located with RECOMB 2025 in Seoul, South Korea.</p>

  <p>The RECOMB satellite conference on Comparative Genomics, founded in 2003, brings together leading researchers in the mathematical, computational, and life sciences to discuss cutting-edge research in comparative genomics, with an emphasis on computational approaches and novel experimental results. The program includes invited speakers, contributed talks, and poster sessions.</p>

  <p>Contributions on any theoretical and/or empirical approach to genome-wide comparison are welcome. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Genome evolution</li>
      <li>Genome rearrangements</li>
      <li>Genomic variation, diversity, and dynamics</li>
      <li>Gene identification and annotation</li>
      <li>Methods for genome assembly</li>
      <li>Cancer evolutionary genomics</li>
      <li>Comparative epigenomics</li>
      <li>Population genomics</li>
      <li>Pangenomics</li>
      <li>Phylogenomics and phylodynamics</li>
      <li>Paleogenomics</li>
      <li>Epidemiology and related areas</li>
      <li>Metagenomics</li>
      <li>Machine learning in genomics</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We encourage submissions that offer new biological findings or otherwise highlight their relevance to biology. Accepted contributions will be presented at the RECOMB-CG 2025 meeting. Selected contributions will be invited to participate in a special issue of the Journal of Computational Biology (with publication fees).</p>
