# Paper and Poster Submissions

## Poster submissions

We welcome submission of posters reporting on original research (both theoretical and experimental) in all areas of computational molecular biology. We encourage submissions that offer new biological findings or otherwise highlight their relevance to biology. Abstracts of posters must be submitted online through the EasyChair submission system (see the link on the right). The poster submissions will be continually evaluated until the submission deadline, which is April 2, 2023.

## Paper submissions

Submitted manuscripts may not have not been published or be currently under consideration for publication in any other journal or conference with a refereed, archival proceedings. Accepted papers will be published as a proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (LNBI) series from Springer-Verlag. Each accepted paper must be presented by one of the authors at the conference.

Submitted papers must be at most 15 pages in length (in the LNBI format), excluding references, with optionally a clearly marked appendix containing supplementary material. While appendices will be available to the reviewers, consideration of supplementary material is left to the reviewers' discretion. Manuscripts should provide a complete account of the results presented without referring to the supplementary material.

**All manuscripts must be registered through EasyChair by a pre-submission deadline and submitted by a submission deadline** (see Key dates). Authors should submit their manuscripts in a PDF formatted according to the [LNBI series guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) (see templates in the right column). Authors are encouraged to include their ORCID in their manuscripts.

## Journal publication

Extended versions of selected accepted papers will be invited for a post-conference publication in a special issue of the Journal of Computational Biology.
