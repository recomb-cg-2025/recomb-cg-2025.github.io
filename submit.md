Submitted manuscripts may not have not been published or be currently under consideration for publication in any other journal or conference with a refereed, archival proceedings. The Program Committee will rigorously review submitted manuscripts. Each accepted paper must be presented by one of the authors at the conference. Accepted papers will be published as a proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (LNBI) series from Springer-Verlag, which will be available at the conference. Authors should submit their manuscripts in PDF format according to the LNBI series guidelines: [http://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](http://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) and use the proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word. Springerâ€™s proceedings LaTeX templates are also available in Overleaf. Authors are encouraged to include their ORCIDs in their manuscripts.

**Authors of accepted papers have the following options:**.

In both cases, while appendices will be available to reviewers, consideration of supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers. Manuscripts should provide a complete account of the results presented, without reference to the supplementary material.
